        <p class="post-text">2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency
            businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a
            series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to miners.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly
            losses, and soaring bitcoin hashrates that reached all-time highs. All these factors
            were affecting the profitability of the miners and were causing sell pressure.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s,
            plummeted. Bitcoin, which was hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of
            $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data collected from The Block, bitcoin
            miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral
            alongside other cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major
            effect on the income and profits of miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue
            in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue,
            according to the data from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206%
            year-over-year increase.</p>
