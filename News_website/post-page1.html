        <p class="post-text">The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.</p>
        <p class="post-text">After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020,
            PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital
            assets between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature
            is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in
            the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
            In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via
            Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full
            Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services for the conduct.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of
            the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a
            one-time ID verification before the procedure.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on
            their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such
            fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
            transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming
            transfers,</p>
        <p class="post-text">The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services,
            such as central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also
            exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The
            discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the
            source code of the company's iPhone app.</p>
